# Notes
Notes customization.

- `Show` : Whether or not to show the notes.
- `Gravity` : How small&slow or tall&fast are the notes. Also affects the spread speed of particles. Does not change the pace. This is not like physical gravity.
- `Color - [border]` : Which color to tend towards, towards the [border] border of the video.  
When having light and dark colors on different borders, the lighter color will change the color of a pixel less than the darker color.  
You could say "Darker partly absorbs lighter".  
For example, let's say you have pure blue on the left and pure red on the right. If bottom is completely white and top is completely black, this will result in notes color being: at the bottom a gradient from pure red to pure blue, left to right ; at the top only black.
