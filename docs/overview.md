# Overview

This application provides only visuals for piano videos, no sound at all.  

When launching it, a .mid file selector will open. Not choosing such a file will stop the whole program.  
Once you have chosen a .mid file and chosen your parameters, you may click `âœ¨ Start rendering` or close the window (once only) to start rendering.  
Once the render has started, the opened window won't be updated, for performance (the render happens in the background). Closing it will stop the render early, but you can minimize it to hide it. Otherwise, the window will automatically close when the whole song is recorded.
