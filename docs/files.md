# Files
The choice of the input and output files.

- `Input .mid file` : Opens a file selector for .mid files, which contain the data of your song used for the visuals.
- `Output (.mkv or .avi)` : The name (with extension) of the output video file. Note .mkv and .avi provide lossless compression, that's why they are used instead of common .mp4 files. Other formats may work, but aren't guaranteed to.
