# Render
About *encoding* the video.

- `Speed vs Compression` : How fast the video will have finished encoding. The downside of faster encoding is a larger output file size.  
Rendering in `Ultrafast` mode is highly discouraged, as it can climb up to several gigabytes "ultra fast".  
Note that if you have a very high number of particles (e.g. 50 000), setting this to something fast might not help much, so you might prefer going slow instead (the difference won't really be felt).
- `âœ¨ Start rendering` : Starts the render.
