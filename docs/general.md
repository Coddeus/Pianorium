# General
General parameters of the rendered video.

- `Width` : The width of the video.
- `Height` : The height of the video.
- `Samples` : The number of samples per pixel. A higher value is highly recommended: it will produce a smoother, more precise rendering, for negligible speed loss.
- `Framerate` : The framerate of the video. 30 or 60 is recommended.
- `Vertical flip` : Whether or not to completely mirror the video upside down.
