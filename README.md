# Pianorium
A free and open-source midi visualizing tool, powered by OpenGL.

## What it should become
Input a midi file or connect a cable, and get a resulting beautiful animation, like those Youtube piano videos (or customizeable), with 60 fps on your screen and as a .mp4 video.

## Program information
A minimum resolution of â‰ƒ800x800 is highly recommended to prevent strange errors.

## License
GNU GPL v3, see [LICENSE](LICENSE).
